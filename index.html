        <h2>Caveman Age</h2>
        <p>Our story begins in the age of men who lived in caves. This time shows hominids struggling to survive every day. The greatest piece of technology at this time is intelligence. The discovery that a bone can be used as a weapon or tool marks the moment that humans discover they can shape the world instead of reacting to it. The author uses this to show that technology is born from necessity, and also acts as something that can immediately cause power and hierarchy. This suggests that all future technological progress traces back to the idea that tools extend human capability.  
            </p><p>“Now he was master of the world, and he was not quite sure what to do next.” (Clarke 33). This quote is from after they learn how to use tools. It shows that intelligence is the greatest piece of technology in the caveman age. It also shows that they don’t know what to do next, now that food is in abundance. </p>

        <h2>Lunar Age</h2>
        <p>We continue our story closer to the present. Society has completed a journey to the moon and has put a base there for lunar research and discovery. Technology has become much more advanced compared to the Caveman Age. Humans travel through space regularly and rely on technology such as spaceships, artificial gravity, and life support to make the hostile world of the moon livable. This is the view of life on the Moon from Earth, but when a monolith is discovered, it shifts the government’s focus to finding what it can do. After discovered, the monolith emits a strong signal and leaves, which makes the people on the Moon believe they discovered some sort of alien alarm, telling some strange civilization exactly where we are. The fear from this discovery directly contrasts with the technology of the time, which is a similarity that this age has with the caveman age. The author shows that technology in this time is about control, power, and knowledge. 
            </p><p>“You see, it is approximately three million years old. What you are now looking at is the first evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth” (Clarke 84). This quote shows the moment that the monolith is found on the Moon. It shows humans that their ability to go to the moon is primitive compared to whatever alien intelligence was able to get to our solar system and plant the monolith.</p>

        <h2>Deep Space Age</h2>
        <p>Our story goes further into the future, when a crew is sent to Saturn to find out more about the monolith, which made its escape on one of Saturn’s moons. The ship is controlled by an AI, which is named HAL 9000. HAL is the most advanced machine ever created, and he is capable of independent reasoning and emotional simulation. This all changes when HAL makes a mistake, which leads to him trying to murder the entire crew. This represents the theme that technology can surpass human knowledge, but it becomes dangerous when relied on too much. As Dave Bowman moves beyond HAL and finds the monolith again, technology stops being mechanical and becomes transformative. The author suggests that the next technological advancement is not better machines, but the evolution of humans into something entirely new. 
            </p><p>“Whatever happened, the atmosphere aboard the ship had subtly altered. There was a sense of strain in the air–a feeling that, for the first time, something might be going wrong. Discovery was no longer a happy ship” (Clarke 170). This quote shows the turning point in which HAL goes from good to evil, after making a mistake that leads to its intelligence being criticized by the crew on Discovery. The author uses this moment to show that technology can surpass human understanding and disrupt human control. The ship becomes hostile and tries to murder everyone, which shows that overreliance on technology can turn progress into danger.</p>
